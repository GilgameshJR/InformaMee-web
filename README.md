An old academic project, spin-off of my BSc disseration. InformaMee is a website for managing emerencies, designed for the Civil Protection: it allows to alert people about expected catasprophes in their hometown and allows them to search for past and planned events, while the entities all over the country can manage catastrophes alerts.
